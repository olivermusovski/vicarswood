	        		Robert Sargeant began fine working and supplied unique furniture to Northern California.  His son endured the apprenticeship and inherited the tools in 2014.  These skills and tools formed Vicarswood.  Located now in Las Vegas, this small workshop offers an interesting place to work as well as producing progressive furniture.
